### I like the [TOTEM](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM/tree/main) by GEIST but not a fan of the splayed layout and wanted something more compact. Having the thumb cluster angled also makes it somewhat awkaward with it sticking out. I removed the upper corner keys to make the keyboard as small as possible to maximize desk space and portability.
